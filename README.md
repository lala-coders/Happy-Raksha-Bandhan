# Happy-Raksha-Bandhan
Raksha Bandhan is a beautiful Indian festival that celebrates the unbreakable bond of love, care, and protection between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "Rakhi" on their brotherâ€™s wrist, symbolizing their love and prayers for his well-being, while brothers promise to protect their sisters in all circumstances
